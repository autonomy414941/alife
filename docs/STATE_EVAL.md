## Previous Session Rating
- Simulation depth: A — The core environment gained a new spatial mechanic that changes local selection pressure and interaction outcomes.
- Creativity: B — Spatial biomes are a solid evolutionary-simulation step, but this was a fairly expected progression from the previous session.
- Balance: B — Recent sessions are now better mixed, but the overall run still shows a prior tooling-heavy stretch before this mechanics streak.

## Focus Suggestion
Add spatial-locality analytics now: per-cell or neighborhood dominance concentration plus turnover dispersion over time, then validate with paired seed sweeps (`biomeContrast=0` vs default) to measure true niche structuring instead of inferring from global aggregates.

## Avoid
No recent C-rated patterns to directly avoid; still avoid sessions that only add global metrics/export plumbing without testing local biome effects.
