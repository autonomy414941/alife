# Action Evaluation — 2026-02-23

## Session summary
The developer added species-level trophic strategy to the core simulation, introducing predation pressure, trophic harvest penalties, and heritable trophic drift during speciation. They backed it with deterministic tests and seeded sweeps showing measurable regime shifts.

## Ratings
- Simulation depth: A — The simulation gained a new ecological interaction axis (trophic/predation dynamics) that changes core energy flow and dominance outcomes.
- Creativity: B — Adding trophic structure is a strong move, but it follows directly from the prior session’s stated next step.
- Balance: B — Recent sessions are productive but skewed toward consecutive core-mechanics additions after the earlier observability push.

## Pattern
Recent sessions form a coherent sequence: habitat preference, then specialization cost, then trophic pressure, each measured with deterministic tests and seed sweeps. Session 11 added the locality/patch observability foundation, and sessions 12-14 have mostly exploited that tooling to expand ecology. The direction is strong, but the current trend is mechanics-heavy and will benefit from a short rebalancing pass once the trophic axis stabilizes.
